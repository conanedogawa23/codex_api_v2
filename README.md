- `docs/README.md` – project overview, setup, deployment, and contribution details
- `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` – environment configuration and local development steps
- `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` – high-level status and architecture summary
- `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` – handy commands and snippets for day-to-day work
- `docs/GRAPHQL_EXAMPLES.md` – sample queries and mutations for the API
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` – coding standards and best practices

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and launch the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Configure environment variables in `.env` (see `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` for details).
