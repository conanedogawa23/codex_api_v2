- Removed redundant info logs throughout application
- Server startup now shows: `Server running on port 4000 [development]`
- Kept only essential error and warning logs
- Simplified shutdown logging

#### Code Quality
- Removed emoji usage from all logger statements (compliance with development rules)
- Simplified environment configuration
- Reduced code complexity across multiple files

### Added
- `.env.example` - Clean environment variable template

### Removed

### Migration Guide

**For existing deployments:**
1. Remove `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` from your `.env` file (no longer used)

3. To restrict origins in production, modify `src/middleware/security.ts` directly
4. Expect cleaner, more concise logs

**No code changes required** - All functionality is preserved.
